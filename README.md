## Development Approach

1. **Incremental Development**: Each phase builds upon the previous ones, allowing for testing and refinement before moving forward.

2. **Testing Focus**: Comprehensive testing at each phase, including:
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests for feature interactions
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Solver verification

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Efficient data structures for board representation
   - Optimized algorithms for solving and generation
   - Careful memory management for infinite boards
   - Network optimization for multiplayer

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Rust installed (latest stable version)
2. Clone the repository
3. Run `cargo build` to build the project
4. Run `cargo test` to run the test suite
5. Run `cargo run` to start the game
